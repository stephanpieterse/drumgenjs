DRUMGEN-JS
-------

This is a nodejs + docker + lilypond project to generate nicelooking patterns for use in drum excercises.
There is an html page as well as a cordova project for android frontend.

BUILD
---
Run `bash buildandrun.sh` for both app and backend, or `bash run.sh` for only the backend.
Currently the backend is hardcoded to my current public instance at drumgen.apollolms.co.za
